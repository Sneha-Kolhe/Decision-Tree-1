    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds a predictive model in the form of a tree structure by recursively partitioning the feature space based on the values of input features, ultimately leading to the prediction of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with the entire dataset at the root node of the tree.\n",
    "It selects the best feature to split the dataset based on a chosen criterion (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy) that maximizes the homogeneity (purity) of the resulting subsets.\n",
    "The dataset is partitioned into subsets based on the values of the selected feature.\n",
    "This process is recursively applied to each subset until one of the stopping criteria is met (e.g., maximum tree depth, minimum number of samples in a node, maximum number of nodes).\n",
    "Decision Node:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on the value of a specific feature.\n",
    "The decision is made by comparing the value of the feature to a threshold (or set of thresholds) determined during the training process.\n",
    "Depending on whether the condition is true or false, the algorithm follows the corresponding branch of the tree to the next node.\n",
    "Leaf Node (Terminal Node):\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf nodes of the tree represent the final predictions or class labels.\n",
    "Each leaf node corresponds to a specific class label, determined by the majority class of the training samples that reach that node.\n",
    "When a new sample reaches a leaf node during prediction, the class label associated with that leaf node is assigned as the predicted class for the sample.\n",
    "Splitting Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm selects the best feature and threshold to split the dataset at each decision node based on a splitting criterion.\n",
    "Common splitting criteria include:\n",
    "Gini impurity: Measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen sample if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of class labels in the node.\n",
    "Entropy: Measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder in a set of samples, with lower entropy indicating higher homogeneity.\n",
    "Pruning (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "After the decision tree is constructed, pruning techniques may be applied to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n",
    "Pruning involves removing parts of the tree that are not statistically significant or do not contribute significantly to improving predictive accuracy.\n",
    "Advantages of Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to understand and interpret.\n",
    "Can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "Requires minimal data preprocessing (e.g., feature scaling, encoding).\n",
    "Can capture nonlinear relationships between features and target variable.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.\n",
    "Can be sensitive to small variations in the data.\n",
    "May not generalize well to unseen data if not pruned properly."
